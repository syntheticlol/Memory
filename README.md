Python Memory Management Tool using cython (ctypes)
This Python script provides a simple tool for managing memory using cython (ctypes), a foreign function library for Python. It includes functionality for both memory allocation and deallocation, leveraging the Python C API.

Features
Cross-platform Compatibility: The script dynamically selects the appropriate Python DLL based on the system's platform, ensuring compatibility across different operating systems.
Flexible Memory Allocation: Users can allocate memory of varying sizes using the allocatedicks method, providing flexibility in memory management.
Efficient Memory Deallocation: The ilikethatarabicguyinthegc method frees allocated memory and triggers garbage collection to ensure efficient memory usage and prevent memory leaks.
Usage
To use the Python Memory Management Tool, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/syntheticlol/memory
Navigate to the Directory:

bash
Copy code
cd memory
Run the Script:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Interact with the Tool:

Upon running the script, memory allocation and deallocation will be performed automatically.
The script will print "Done.." once the process is complete.
Note
It's important to exercise caution when manually managing memory, as improper usage can lead to memory leaks and other issues. Ensure that memory is allocated and deallocated appropriately to maintain the stability and efficiency of your Python applications.
